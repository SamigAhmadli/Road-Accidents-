# Road Accident Dashboard (2021-2022)

## Description
This Excel project creates a dynamic dashboard to analyze road accident data for 2021 and 2022. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization features such as pivot tables, charts, and interactive filters.

Technologies Used
Excel: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

Problem Statement
We must analyze key indicators for road accident data to gain insights into road safety. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

Total Casualties: The sum of all casualties in road accidents.
Accident Severity: The distribution of accident severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Slight).
Casualties by Vehicle Type: The number of casualties involving different vehicle types.
Monthly and Yearly Trends: Trends in road accidents over months and years.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Fix typos, filter data, and ensure consistency.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Add columns for month and year to analyze trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Create donut charts, bar charts, and tree maps for insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Use slicers and timelines to filter data dynamically.

## Installation
1. Download the Excel file (`road_accident_dashboard.xlsx`) from this repository.
2. Open the file in **Microsoft Excel** (2016 or later).

## Usage
1. **Data Input**: Load your dataset into the `Data` sheet.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Use the `Find and Replace` tool to fix typos (e.g., "Fetal" to "Fatal").
3. **Data Analysis**: Explore the `KPIs` sheet for pivot tables and calculations.
4. **Dashboard**: Navigate to the `Dashboard` sheet to view visualizations and interact with filters.
